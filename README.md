## Installation & Running

1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed:
   ```
   # Using uv (recommended)
   pip install uv
   uv venv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Or using standard venv
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install pygame pytest
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```
   python battle-snake.py
   ```

## Testing

The game includes unit tests to prevent regression bugs, especially for the control keys (C, R, Q).

### Running tests
```bash
# Install uv if needed
pip install uv

# Then run the tests script
./run_tests.sh
```

The test suite verifies:
- Control key functionality (C, R, Q)
- Hunter snake targeting logic
- Food interaction mechanics
- Collision detection

## Development Notes

- Built with Python and Pygame
- Features advanced pathfinding for the hunter snake
- Includes collision detection for walls, self, other snake, and screen boundaries
- Implements game state tracking (playing, paused, game over)
- Uses a simple file-based highscore system
